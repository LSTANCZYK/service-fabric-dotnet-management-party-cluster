        <h1>SERVICE FABRIC PARTY CLUSTER WEBSITE TERMS OF USE</h1>
        <h2>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
        The Website Services (as defined in the next section) that Microsoft provides to you on this website (“Website”) are subject to the following Terms of Use ("TOU"). Microsoft reserves the right to update the TOU at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the TOU can be reviewed by clicking on the "Terms of Use" hypertext link located on the Website pages. 
        <h2>DESCRIPTION OF WEBSITE SERVICES</h2>
        This Website provides you with the ability to test the Microsoft Azure Service Fabric service (“Service Fabric”) by using one or more publicly available Service Fabric clusters (“Party Clusters”). You may request access to a Party Cluster through the Website. You may upload applications to your assigned Party Cluster for the sole purpose of testing and evaluating Service Fabric. Microsoft may allow multiple different users to upload and run applications in the same Party Cluster. Party Clusters are intended solely for testing and evaluation of Service Fabric ; therefore, Microsoft may periodically reset Party Clusters. Resetting a Party Cluster will result in the deletion of all applications and data stored in the Party Cluster, and any links previously sent to the Party Cluster will no longer be valid. You may not run any production workloads in a Party Cluster. The above-described functionality and all other functionality, services, resources, and information made available through the Website are referred to as the “Website Services.” The Website Services, including any updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new web properties, are subject to these TOU. 
        <h2>PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION</h2>
        The Website Services are intended solely for testing and evaluation of Service Fabric .

You agree not to upload any applications or data to the Website Services that include personal information or any other sensitive data. If you provide your email address or other personal information to Microsoft though the Website Services, or if you sign into the Website Services using your Microsoft Account, Microsoft will treat your personal information in accordance with the Microsoft Privacy Statement, which pertains to the Website Services.

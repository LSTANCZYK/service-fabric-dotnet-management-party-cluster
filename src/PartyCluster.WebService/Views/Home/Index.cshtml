                <h4>what's a party cluster?</h4>
                <p>
                    Party clusters are open, public Service Fabric clusters hosted on Azure and run by the Service Fabric team where anyone can deploy applications and learn about the platform. For free!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>how does it work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Just click to join a cluster and we'll send you information on how to connect and deploy your applications. No subscriptions or sign-ups required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each party cluster is the same and has a time limit. It runs for a few hours, then it's automatically taken down and a fresh new one comes up.
                    At that point, all your applications will be removed and you'll have to connect to a new cluster to keep partying.
                    You can only connect to one party cluster at a time, but you can come back as many times as you like.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>what are the rules?</h4>
                <p>
                    You can deploy any application you like to learn about the platform - we suggest starting with one of our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples/?service=service-fabric" target="_blank">sample applications</a>.
                    But remember, these clusters are public and shared with others, so everyone can see your applications. Please see our <a href="termsofuse.html">Terms of Use</a> for all the details.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>cool, does this run on Service Fabric too?</h4>
                <p>
                    Of course! The Party Clusters and this web page are managed by a Service Fabric application which is <a href="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-dotnet-management-party-cluster" target="_blank">open source and available on GitHub</a>.

                    <h4>what's this about?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Party Clusters are shared Service Fabric clusters on Azure run by the Service Fabric team where you can deploy applications and learn about the platform. For free.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>how does it work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Just click to join a cluster and we'll send you its connection address so you can start partying away.
                        Each Party Cluster is the same and has a time limit. It runs for two hours, then it's automatically taken down and a fresh new one comes up so they don't get too cluttered.
                        You can connect as many times as you want.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>what are the rules?</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can deploy any application you like to learn about the platform - we suggest starting with one of our sample applications.
                        But remember, these are shared clusters, so others can see your applications.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>cool, does this run on Service Fabric too?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Glad you asked! The Party Clusters and this web page are managed by a Service Fabric application which is open source and available on GitHub.

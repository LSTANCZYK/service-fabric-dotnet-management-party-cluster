                To join the cluster, just fill in your name and email address, and the cluster address will be emailed to you.
                These are unsecured clusters, so once you have the cluster address you can connect normally.

                    <h4>wat</h4>
                    <p>
                        Party Clusters are shared Service Fabric clusters on Azure run by the Service Fabric team where you can deploy applications and learn about the platform. For free.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>how does it work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Just click to join a cluster and we'll send you its connection address so you can start partying away.
                        Each Party Cluster is the same and has a time limit. It runs for two hours, then it's automatically taken down and a fresh new one comes up so they don't get too cluttered.
                        You can connect as many times as you want.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>what are the rules?</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can deploy any application you like to learn about the platform - we suggest starting with one of our sample applications.
                        But remember, these are shared clusters, so others can see your applications.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>cool, does this run on Service Fabric too?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Glad you asked! The Party Clusters and this web page are managed by a Service Fabric application which is open source and available on GitHub.

<h1>Thanks for trying out Microsoft Azure Service Fabric!</h1>
<h3>Your party cluster address is: <strong>__clusterAddress__</strong></h3>
<h3>Your port number is: <strong>__userPort__</strong></h3>
<p>This cluster will expire <strong>__clusterExpiration__</strong>. That gives you <strong>__clusterTimeRemaining__</strong> to deploy applications until the cluster is taken down, but you can connect to a new one as many times as you want.</p>
<p>The cluster is shared but the port is yours to use in your applications. To connect to the cluster and deploy applications, please refer to the guides here and here. Please familiarize yourself with the rules <TBD:link> and the terms <TBD:link> of using this service. </p>
<h3 style="color:red"> 
All your applications will be publicly visible and can be deleted by other users on this cluster. Furthermore, the cluster can be reset earlier than the prescribed time per Microsoft’s discretion. 
</h3>
Please refer to the full terms of the service <TBD-link> for more details.

Thanks, and have fun!
